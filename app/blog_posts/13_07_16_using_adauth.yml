summary: "How and why would one use Adauth?"

body: "Over the past couple of weeks I have spent alot of time working on Adauth adding minor improvements to the code and refactoring a lot of it. What I wan't to go over here is the how and why of Adauth.\r\n\r\n
First off why use it?\r\n\r\n
Active Directory is Microsofts LDAP service which runs on Windows Server and is used by companies all over the planet to manage users and groups. AD does a lot more that users &amp; groups and intergrates entirely with many services on Windows Server and most importantly intergrates with lots of 3rd Party services. A lot of popular software titles can either sync with or directly talk to AD to provide Authentication, which turns AD into a SSO (Signle Sign On) Solution.\r\n\r\n
Adauth started off as some embedded code in one of the apps I wrote for [url=http://www.ed-itsolutions.com]Ed-IT Solutions[/url] but I very quickly realised how much better it would be to use this on all apps and end all the \"I've forgotten my password for X\" messages I got. So very quickly that day Adauth 0.0.1 was born and intergrated into all our applications.\r\n\r\n
Now 2 years down the line Adauth has grown to have a pretty hefty feature list with more being added all the time. The 2.x code which released a few weeks ago is a 100% rewrite from scratch with none of the 1.x code coming over. This new version was built around a super class for all objects in AD with special methods like [i]authenticate[/i] being defined in the sub classes."
